Here’s a **full roadmap for building “1%”** as a 3D life simulation game:

---

## **Phase 1: Concept & Planning**

- **Game Design Document (GDD)**:
    - Define core mechanics: life progression, economy, decision-making.
    - Outline systems: education, jobs, entrepreneurship, government, transport.
    - Create player journey: birth → childhood → adulthood → career → wealth.
- **Art Style & Theme**:
    - Decide on visual style (realistic, stylized, low-poly).
    - UI/UX mockups for menus and stats.

---

## **Phase 2: Core Systems Development**

- **Engine Setup**:
    - Choose **Unity** for flexibility and cross-platform support.
    - Set up project structure (Scenes: City, Home, School, Business).
- **Player System**:
    - Character creation (gender, name).
    - Basic movement & camera controls.
- **UI System**:
    - Stats: Money, Health, Happiness.
    - Decision menus (education, job, business).
- **Time System**:
    - Day/Night cycle.
    - Age progression.

---

## **Phase 3: City & Environment**

- **City Layout**:
    - Roads, buildings (school, bank, theater, stock exchange).
    - Transport system (cars, buses).
- **3D Assets**:
    - Use free assets initially (Unity Asset Store).
    - Later, custom models for branding.
- **Map Navigation**:
    - Zoom in/out, click to interact with locations.

---

## **Phase 4: Economy & Simulation**

- **Business Logic**:
    - Jobs: salary, promotions.
    - Entrepreneurship: start business, manage expenses.
- **Stock Market System**:
    - Dynamic prices, player investments.
- **Government & Taxes**:
    - Policies affecting economy.
- **Education System**:
    - Skills unlock better jobs.

---

## **Phase 5: AI & NPCs**

- NPCs for city life (workers, students).
- Social interactions (friends, networking).
- Dynamic events (economic boom, recession).

---

## **Phase 6: Advanced Features**

- **Transport & Travel**:
    - Buy cars, use buses, overseas trips.
- **Life Events**:
    - Marriage, family, health issues.
- **Endgame**:
    - Become part of the 1% or fail financially.

---

## **Phase 7: Polish & Release**

- Optimize performance.
- Add sound, music, animations.
- Beta testing & feedback.
- Release on PC (Steam), then expand to mobile.

---

### **Tools & Tech**

- **Unity + C#**
- **Blender** for custom 3D models.
- **Firebase or PlayFab** for cloud saves.
- **Photon** for multiplayer (optional).

---

✅ Next Step: I can **create the detailed Game Design Document (GDD)** for “1%” with all mechanics, UI mockups, and system flow.  
Do you want me to **start writing the GDD now**, or **prepare a Unity starter project with basic city and player controls**?
