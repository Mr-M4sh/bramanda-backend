--------------------------------------------
CSP ( Cloud Service Provider )
	-The information of the data center  (server ) is hosted by Cloud service provider
Data Center
	-A physical building that stores servers, computer system, and associated components
Cloud Deployment models
		1. Public 
		2. Private
		3. Hybrid
1. public :A cloud model that delivers computing , storage, and network resources through the internet, allowing users to share on demand resources (multi -tenant environment)
2. private: A cloud model in which all cloud resources are dedicated to a single user or organization as they own infrastructure with their own data center ( single - tenant environment)
3. Hybrid : A cloud model that combines public and private models so organizations can enjoy both cloud services and the control features of on-premises cloud models
Virtualization 
	-Technology that creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networks
Hypervisor
	-The abstraction layer that sits between the physical computer and the virtual machine
	1) Type 1, also known as bare metal ( which replaces the whole operating system)
	2) Type 2 , hosted
Cloud Storage 
	-files
	object ( unstructured data)
	-blocks
	 
- **Bucket**: A virtual container that holds objects.  
- **Cloud computing**: The practice of using on-demand computing resources as services hosted over the internet.  
- **Cloud cybersecurity**: The practice of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based data, applications, and infrastructure by preventing unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.  
- **Cloud data storage**: A solution that enables organizations to keep, access, and maintain digital data on off-site, cloud-based storage devices.  
- **Compute**: Computation performed by a physical computer in a remote environment.  
- **Container**: A software package that holds only the components necessary to execute a particular application.  
- **Data center**: A physical building that stores servers, computer systems, and associated components.  
- **Digital transformation**: When an organization modernizes their applications, services, and customer relationships by using new technologies.  
- **Ephemerality**: The concept that things only exist for a short amount of time.  
- **Failure domain**: A resource that can fail without impacting the availability of data.  
- **Hybrid cloud**: A cloud model that combines public and private models, so organizations can enjoy both cloud services and the control features of on-premises cloud models.  
- **Hypervisor**: The abstraction layer that sits between the physical computer and the virtual machine.  
- **Immutability**: The concept of being unable to change an object after it’s created and assigned a value.  
- **Instance**: A server resource that runs workloads in the cloud.  
- **Latency**: The time it takes for data to travel from one location to another.  
- **Multicloud**: A strategy of using more than one cloud service provider.  
- **Multi-tenant environment**: An environment in which cloud infrastructure and resources are shared among users.  
- **On-premises**: Information technology infrastructure that’s physically located in an organization’s own data center or office.  
- **Private cloud**: A cloud model in which all cloud resources are dedicated to a single user or organization and are created, managed, and owned within on-premises data centers.  
- **Public cloud**: A cloud model that delivers computing, storage, and network resources through the internet, allowing users to share on-demand resources.  
- **Redundancy**: The practice of having multiple copies of data in different locations to avoid a single point of failure.  
- **Region**: A group of zones.  
- **Repository**: A centralized place to store, download, and share data.  
- **Resiliency**: The ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions.  
- **Single-tenant environment**: An environment in which cloud infrastructure and resources are dedicated to a single user.  
- **Structured data**: Data organized in a certain format, like rows and columns.  
- **Unstructured data**: Data that is not organized in any easily identifiable way.  
- **Virtualization**: Technology that creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networks.  
- **Zone**: The collective number of data centers in an area.
